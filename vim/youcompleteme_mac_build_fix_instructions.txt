Instructions taken from: https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe/issues/1018

Generate Makefile using CMake, providing the appropriate paths to Python library and headers:
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DPYTHON_LIBRARY=/opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/libpython2.7.dylib -DPYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR=/opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Headers . ~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe/third_party/ycmd/cpp

Then add the following to .vimrc to let Vim use the same Python that was used to compile YouCompleteMe
" To allow YouCompleteMe to use the same Python that was used to compile it
let $PATH = '/opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/libpython2.7.dylib -DPYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR=/opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Headers'.$PATH

Note: YouCompleteMe must be used with MacVim. So in .profile
alias vim=mvim
or
alias vim=mvim -v # -v is vi mode
